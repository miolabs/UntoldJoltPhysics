//
//  C API over Jolt Physics for the Untold Engine physics backend plugin.
//  Deliberately narrow: it mirrors the engine's PhysicsBackend protocol
//  (bodies in, kinematic targets in, step, transforms out, buffered events
//  out, one raycast) so the Swift side stays a thin adapter, plus the plugin's
//  own extras (soft bodies, a character controller, ragdolls). All functions except
//  the event drains must be called from one thread (the engine's frame
//  thread); Jolt's own worker threads never call back into Swift.
